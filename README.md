# Case_Study_ofDFI

This is Case Study of Dairy Farm Group (DFI) a Hong Kong based retail group.
In this case study I used datasets from CSISG2017,DFI group store location data etc to visualize and revitalize the marketing/business strategy to recapture the SG marketshare by capitalizing the marketshare that has not been capitalized yet.
